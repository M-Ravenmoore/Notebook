## Variables how they work
variables look like this :
>var name;

- you assign variable using `=` folowed by what you want it to be assigned to.

- functions are a group of statements that run together to do one task
- functions are reusable
- name/value pairs important language
- A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both
- functions should atempt to be one task
- functions should be named intuitively
- Functions can be passed into other functions as paramete
